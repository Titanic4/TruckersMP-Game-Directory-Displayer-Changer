# TruckersMP-Game-Directory-Displayer-Changer
This program is for displaying the game directories, as well as changing it when needed. 
When building the program, you should notice the UAC shield near application's icon. 
This is because the app requires admin privileges to work correctly. 
This is required, because the app accesses HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry key. 
After starting the app, you should see the path to firstly found game on the list, as well as game version for selected path. 
This was made in Visual Studio 2017. You can try building the program in older Visual Studio, but don't expect the successful build.
Microsoft .Net Framework 4.5 or later is required.
